# 🧸 Forky

Welcome to **Forky** — a fork-friendly development convention designed to make upstream code changes ✨ clean ✨, 😌 safe 😌, and 💥 merge-proof 💥.

When you work in a fork of a large codebase (like Telegram), it’s easy to fall into chaos: silent overwrites, messy merges, mystery bugs caused by untracked changes…

That’s where **Forky** comes in.

## ✨ What is Forky?

**Forky** is not just a tool. It’s a mindset.

It’s a simple but powerful convention:
> 🧠 “All changes to upstream code must be explicit, visible, and respectful.”

It means that all your edits, tweaks, and interventions into upstream files should be *intentionally marked* and *structurally predictable*. This enables:

- 💬 Safer merges from upstream
- 🔍 Automated detection of unmarked changes
- 🛠 Easier debugging (you always know what’s yours)
- 🤝 Cleaner collaboration on forks

Forky is built to grow — with tools, scripts, and possibly even plugins.

## 🪄 Origin Story

Forky was born when Darlingram — already a fork of Telegram —
added a second copy of upstream Telegram as a **Git submodule**.

> We forked Telegram,
> then added Telegram as a submodule
> *inside the same repo.*

That metaphysical moment — a fork watching its own origin —
sparked the creation of Forky: a tiny guardian of merge sanity and diff cleanliness.

## 🧩 What does Forky include?

- 📎 **Structured comment conventions** — so your additions are always wrapped in safe, searchable markers.
- 🔍 **Checker Script** — validates that no upstream code was accidentally overwritten, and all inserted code is properly marked.
- 🧽 **Import Cleaner** — restores upstream import order and lifts your custom imports above them.
- ⚙️ **Spotless** integration — auto-removes unused imports as part of the process.

You can think of it like a seatbelt:
> It won’t stop you from driving into a tree,
> but it’ll make sure you’re not flung into production headfirst 🚗🌳

## 🌈 Why “Forky”?

Because he’s a fork.
And guess what — I’m a fork too!
Plus, he’s a **darling**. 💘
And this is **Darlingram**, after all —
Even your tools should feel loved.
